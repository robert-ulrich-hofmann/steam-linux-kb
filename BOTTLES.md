Battle.NET

Switching from / to any Proton runner to any "normal" Wine runner changes your user and and home directory in the Windows context. (Windows user "steamuser" vs "your-linux-username"). After doing that some games can not access their user settings / files anymore (so far I have seen it with StarCraft II and HOTS) and you need to delete them and all their config files and reinstall them.

Battle.NET / Hots

- Add to `C:\users\YOURUSER\Documents\Heroes of the Stom\Variables.txt`
  ```
  frameratecap=60
  frameratecapGlue=60
  ```
  where `frameratecap` is the fps limit during gaming (focus on application) and `frameratecapGlue` is the fps limit while minimized / out of focus / in certain menus. In HOTS this is, sadly, also concerning the animations in champ select.

Battle.NET / StarCraft II

- Add to `C:\users\YOURUSER\Documents\StarCraft II\Variables.txt`
  ```
  frameratecap=60
  frameratecapGlue=12
  ```
  where `frameratecap` is the fps limit during gaming (focus on application) and `frameratecapGlue` is the fps limit while minimized / out of focus / in certain menus.
