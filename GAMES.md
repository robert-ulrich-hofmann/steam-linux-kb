## Mass Effect Legendary Edition
``gamemoderun %command%``

- experimental
- ge923
- runs exceptionally well stable no jitters no artifacts, 120 fps WOW

## Helldivers 2
``gamemoderun %command% --use-d3d11``
- for some reason dx12 (standard) doesn't work anymore (black screen with running game and hud (you can hear and move normally) as soon as entering any mission), it used to. (uncapped fps, 40-50) and the performance was way better.
- fix for now: ge 925
- --use-d3d11 (allthough performance huge hit)
- stable 40 fps but slo-mo walk
- cap 30

- ge 9.26 lots of crashes, can't load into match
- proton experimental better performance, but lots of after game crashes
- 9.0.4 most stable?
- 7.0.6 best
- first start always freeze entire system for 5-10s
- after that everything works, alt tab works, sometimes sound glitches (big battlefields)

## Sniper Elite: Resistance
``PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=90 gamemoderun %command%``
