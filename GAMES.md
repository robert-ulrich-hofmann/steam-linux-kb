runs exceptionally well stable no jitters no artifacts, 120 fps WOW

## helldivers 2
for some reason dx12 (standard) doesn't work anymore (black screen with running game and hud (you can hear and move normally) as soon as entering any mission), it used to. (uncapped fps, 40-50) and the performance was way better.
fix for now: ge 925
--use-d3d11 (allthough performance huge hit)
stable 40 fps but slo-mo walk
cap 30
