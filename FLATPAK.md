how to use ge-proton with flatpak steam
    easiest way: https://github.com/flathub/com.valvesoftware.Steam.CompatibilityTool.Proton-GE
        upgrades seem nice at first but: silent upgrade. then every game running on this's ge needs to process vulkan shaders again on first start and can break. better peg fixed versions to every game. you can still run "experimental" or "latest" from steam as "auto-update" and first try
    more flexible https://flathub.org/apps/net.davidotek.pupgui2
        cant run while steam is running, have to restart steam or install and run steam after
    dont have both
    todo manually: what does protonupqt do? just extract into some steam flatpak folder?
integrate with other flatpak? mumble?
